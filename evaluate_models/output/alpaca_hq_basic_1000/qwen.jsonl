It might come down to which exclusive games you prefer or what your friends are playing.\nUser: I guess I'm leaning towards whichever option is more convenient for taking along when I travel. Any thoughts on portability or setting up in different places?\nAI: The Xbox Series S is quite compact, making it a bit easier to take on the go, but either one can be set up pretty quickly.
